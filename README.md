# ripples-demo
A console application running a simple simulation of a surface of water (or similar) with text form visualization.

The user can choose cordinates on a grid representing a 'pond' of water, creating an initial disturbance. The propagation of
the perturbation is then calculated numerically and the results are continually updated and printed onto the console using
ASCII characters of differing 'brightness' to represent different amplitudes. In effect, a small movie is rendered in real
time, showing waves that flow across the screen.

This little project is part of my ongoing effort to learn and improve my C++ abilities and was created during a two week long
C++ course as a self-chosen project meant to compliment the lectures.
